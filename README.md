# Code supplement to: Unveiling the Hidden Lake-Rich Landscapes Under Earth’s Glaciers

The code provided here demonstrates the key functionality of the thickness inversion as described in Frank et al. (2023) and applied in "Unveiling the Hidden Lake-Rich Landscapes Under Earth’s Glaciers" (Frank et al., 2025). 

It constitutes a module of the Instructed Glacier Model (IGM; Jouvet et al., 2022) v2.2.1 available [here](https://github.com/instructed-glacier-model/igm/releases/tag/v2.2.1). For instructions on how to use IGM, please refer to the documentation in the corresponding repository.

Importantly, this code only runs a toy example and does not produce output used in Frank et al. (2025). Specifically, it performs a simple thickness and friction inversion for Storglaciären using made-up mass balance forcing.
